# Nuclease Assay % Cut and graphing traces


Get percent cut from nuclease assay sequencer traces

The script will filter the peaks of a size you choose for the cut fragment and uncut fragment.
Then sum areas at each size for each trace.
Then calculate a percent cut.

Exported as csv to graph - I prefer graphing in GraphPad Prism - easier to manipulate and alter graph features.
